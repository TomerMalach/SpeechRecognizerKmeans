function r = vqlbg(d, k, MFCC)
% VQLBG Vector quantization using the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithme
%
% Inputs: d contains training data vectors (one per column)
%         k is number of centroids required
%         MFCC is a flag signaling that were dealing with MFCC otherwise we are dealing with LPC coefficients and autocorrelation matrices
%
% Output: r contains the result VQ codebook (k columns, one for each centroids)
